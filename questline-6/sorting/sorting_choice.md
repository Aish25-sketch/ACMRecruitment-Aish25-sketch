# Sorting Algorithm Choice

I chose **Bubble Sort** because it is simple to understand and implement.  

### How Bubble Sort Works:
- Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
- Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
- Repeat until the list is sorted.

### Example Input:
[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

### Example Output:
[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
