# Three Switches — Which one controls the bulb?

## Sequence of actions
1. Turn **Switch A** ON. Wait about 30–60 seconds.  
2. Turn **Switch A** OFF.  
3. Turn **Switch B** ON.  
4. Immediately go into room 2 (enter once) and check the bulb.

## How to identify
- If the bulb is **lit**, then **Switch B** controls the bulb.  
- If the bulb is **off** but the bulb is **warm**, then **Switch A** controls the bulb (it was recently on and warmed up).  
- If the bulb is **off** and **cold**, then **Switch C** controls the bulb (it was never turned on).

## Logic
- We use heat as a one-time memory: turning on A long enough warms the bulb; turning it off preserves the heat briefly.  
- Turning on B right before entering allows a direct on/off test.  
- C is the remaining possibility if neither warmth nor light are present.
