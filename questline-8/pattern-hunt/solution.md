**Given sequence:** 2, 6, 12, 20, ...

## Next two terms
- **30**
- **42**

## Explanation
The sequence is generated using the formula **n × (n + 1)**, where *n* starts from 1:

- n = 1 → 1 × 2 = 2  
- n = 2 → 2 × 3 = 6  
- n = 3 → 3 × 4 = 12  
- n = 4 → 4 × 5 = 20  
- n = 5 → 5 × 6 = 30  
- n = 6 → 6 × 7 = 42  

Thus, the next two terms are **30** and **42**
