# Sudoku 4x4 â€” Solution

## Puzzle
- - 3 -
- 3 - 1
3 - - -
- 1 - -

## Steps I followed
- Looked at each row, column and 2x2 box.  
- Started filling the easiest spots first (like column 2 which already had 1 and 3, so the rest had to be 2 and 4).  
- After that, each row only had a couple of choices left, so it was just checking what number was missing.  
- Step by step the puzzle filled itself out.

## Final Grid
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
3 4 1 2
2 1 4 3
