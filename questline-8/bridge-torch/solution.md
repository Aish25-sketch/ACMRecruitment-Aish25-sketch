# Bridge and Torch Puzzle

We have 4 people: 1 min, 2 min, 7 min, and 10 min.  
Only two can cross at a time, and the torch must always be carried.

## Steps
1. 1 and 2 cross → 2 min  
2. 1 comes back → +1 min  
3. 7 and 10 cross → +10 min  
4. 2 comes back → +2 min  
5. 1 and 2 cross again → +2 min  

## Total Time
**17 minutes**

## Reasoning
The two fastest (1 and 2) handle most of the shuttling, so the slower ones (7 and 10) only cross once together. That keeps the total time as low as possible.
